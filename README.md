# SudokuSolver
I made a Sudoku Solver! It solves and displays iteratively so the process can be viewed. 

dependencies: packages tkinter and random 

To start, run the program, then enter each known value. Once all given values are entered, press \<enter\>. To see each given answer, press \<enter\> again. 

When the program finds the winning solution, it will output "WON!!!".
